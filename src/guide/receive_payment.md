# Receiving Lightning payments

With the Breez Liquid SDK you aren't required to open a channel and set up your inbound liquidity.

Once the SDK is initialized, you can directly begin receiving payments. 

There are currently three methods for receiving:
- `PaymentMethod::Lightning`: For Lightning to Liquid payments
- `PaymentMethod::BitcoinAddress`: For Bitcoin to Liquid payments
- `PaymentMethod::LiquidAddress`: For Liquid to Liquid payments
