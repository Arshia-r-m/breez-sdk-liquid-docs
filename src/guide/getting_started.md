# Getting Started

Integrating Breez SDK - *Liquid* into your application takes just a few minutes. Follow these steps to get started:
- **[Installing the SDK](/guide/install.md)**
- **[Connecting](/guide/connecting.md)**
- **[Fetching the Wallet State](/guide/wallet_state.md)**
- **[Listening to events](/guide/events.md)**
- **[Adding logging](/guide/logging.md)**

## API Key
The _Liquid_ Breez API key must be set in order for the SDK to work. 
You can request one for free by filling our form <a target="_blank" href="{{api_key_form_uri}}">here</a>.

**Note:** This is not the same as the Greenlight Breez API key, so it cannot be reused.
